def handle_v4_onion_request():
    """
    Handles a decrypted v4 onion request; this injects a subrequest to process it then returns the
    result of that subrequest.  In contrast to v3, it is more efficient (particularly for binary
    input or output) and allows using endpoints that return headers or bodies with non-2xx response
    codes.

    The body of a v4 request (post-decryption) is a bencoded list containing exactly 1 or 2 byte
    strings: the first byte string contains a json object containing the request metadata which has
    three required fields:

    - "endpoint" -- the HTTP endpoint to invoke (e.g. "/room/some-room").
    - "method" -- the HTTP method (e.g. "POST", "GET")
    - "headers" -- dict of HTTP headers for the request.  Header names are case-insensitive (i.e.
      `X-Foo` and `x-FoO` are equivalent).

    Unlike v3 requests, endpoints must always start with a /.  (If a legacy endpoint "whatever"
    needs to be accessed through a v4 request for some reason then it can be accessed via the
    "/legacy/whatever" endpoint).

    The "headers" field typically carries X-SOGS-* authentication headers as well as fields like
    Content-Type.  Note that, unlike v3 requests, the Content-Type does *not* have any default and
    should also be specified, often as `application/json`.  Unlike HTTP requests, Content-Length is
    not required and will be ignored if specified; the content-length is always determined from the
    provided body.

    The second byte string in the request, if present, is the request body in raw bytes and is
    required for POST and PUT requests and must not be provided for GET/DELETE requests.

    Bencoding details:
        A full bencode library can be used, but the format used here is deliberately meant to be as
        simple as possible to implement without a full bencode library on hand.  The format of a
        byte string is `N:` where N is a decimal number (e.g. `123:` starts a 123-byte string),
        followed by the N bytes.  A list of strings starts with `l`, contains any number of encoded
        byte strings, followed by `e`.  (Full bencode allows dicts, integers, and list/dict
        recursion, but we do not use any of that for v4 bencoded onion requests).

    For example, the request:

        GET /room/some-room
        Some-Header: 12345

    would be encoded as:

        l79:{"method":"GET","endpoint":"/room/some-room","headers":{"Some-Header":"12345"}}e

    that is: a list containing a single 79-byte string.  A POST request such as:

        POST /some/thing
        Some-Header: a

        post body here

    would be encoded as the two-string bencoded list:

        l72:{"method":"POST","endpoint":"/some/thing","headers":{"Some-Header":"a"}}14:post body heree
            ^^^^^^^^72-byte request info json^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^body^^^^^

    The return value of the request is always a 2-part bencoded list where the first part contains
    response metadata and the second contains the response body.  The response metadata is a json
    object containing:
    - "code" -- the numeric HTTP response code (e.g. 200, 403); and
    - "headers" -- a json object of header names to values.  Note that, since HTTP headers are
      case-insensitive, the header names are always returned as lower-case, and we strip out the
      'content-length' header (since it is already encoded in the length of the body part).

    For example, a simple json request response might be the two parts:

    - `{"code":200,"headers":{"content-type":"application/json"}}`
    - `{"id": 123}`

    encoded as:

        l58:{"code":200,"headers":{"content-type":"application/json"}}11:{"id": 123}e

    A more complicated request, for example for a file download, might return binary content such as:

    - `{"code":200,"headers":{"content-type":"application/octet-stream","content-disposition":"attachment; filename*=UTF-8''filename.txt"}}`
    - `My file contents`

    i.e. encoded as `l132:{...the json above...}16:My file contentse`

    Error responses (e.g. a 403) are not treated specially; that is: they still have a "code" set to
    the response code and "headers" and a body part of whatever the request returned for a body).

    The final value returned from the endpoint is the encrypted bencoded bytes, and these encrypted
    bytes are returned directly to the client (i.e. no base64 encoding applied, unlike v3 requests).
